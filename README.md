# Final exam Data Managment for big data

The report is the Report.html file.
The dynamic version of the report exceeds the maximum size allowed by GitHub, it can be downloaded from this link and is hosted on my Mega account:

BACKUP download link if MEGA is down, from Google Drive:

I suggest to download the dynamic report, even if it changes only in one interactive plot.

Additional R code, not present in the Report.Rmd file that originated the report is loaded.

There are four files: 

Cleaning.R file which performs cleaning operations on the datasets. 

data_gathering.R which shows how to download data using Rtweet, an R interface for Twitter API's.

The other two are codes for Shiny interactive applications, available from links in the report and hosted on shinyapps.io.

The free version of shinyapps.io allows the loading of five interactive apps, and a cumulative usage of a maximum of 24 hours in a month, so the apps could be unreachable sometimes.
