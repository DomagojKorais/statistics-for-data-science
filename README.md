# Final exam Data Managment for big data

The report is the Report.html file.

Additional R code, not present in the Rmd file that originated the report is loaded.

There are four files: 

Cleaning.R file which performs cleaning operations on the datasets. 

data_gathering.R which shows how to download data using Rtweet, an R interface for Twitter API's.

The other two are codes for Shiny interactive applications, aviable from links in the report and hosted on shinyapps.io.

The free version of shinyapps.io allows the loading of five interactive apps, and a cumulative usage of a maximum of 24 hours in a month, so the apps could be momentarily unaviable.
